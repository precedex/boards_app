The most appropriate action is to
(A) decrease the endobronchial cuff volume
(B) decrease the tracheal cuff volume
(C) reinsert the tube, rotating it 180 degrees to the right
(D) suction both lumens

A 40-year-old woman is undergoing a posterior fossa craniotomy in the sitting position for clipping of a basilar artery aneurysm. Nitroprusside is being used to maintain mean arterial pressure at 50 mmHg, measured at head level. During dissection, over the course of one minute, the mean blood pressure decreases to 30 mmHg.
