    The <%= external_link_to "American Board of Anesthesiology", @aba %> 
    (ABA), under the auspices of the <%= external_link_to "American Board of Medical Specialties", @abms %>  (ABMS), is in the process of changing its requirements for <%= external_link_to "maintenance of certification", @moca %> (MOC). MOCA 2.0 will begin as a 'pilot' program with automatic enrollment for all diplomates whose certification expires in 2016 or later. Those whose certification expires in 2015 or earlier most meet the traditional MOCA requirements. As of January 1, 2016, the four principal components of MOC will be modified as below. See the <%= external_link_to " MOCA 2.0 FAQ", @moca2 %> for more information.
