    The ABA has publicly released the #{external_link_to *@old_aba_exams}.
    While some of the test subject material is no longer actively tested (e.g
    halothane, enflurane, Mapleson circuits), the underlying concepts are largely
    unchanged. Certain material on ACLS algorithms is no longer accurate and you
    should refer to the #{link_to "2010 algorithms", tools_path}. K-type
    questions have been elminated and are not included here.
