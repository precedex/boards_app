      The oral board exam tests your ability to organize your thoughts quickly
      and communicate them efficiently. You are being evaluated on your ability
      to formulate and articulate your thoughts clearly. This is a very different
      skill than that required to excel on the written exam. The single best way
      to prepare for the exam is to simulate the exam experience with a seasoned
      examiner. You must get used to the pace of the exam and thinking on your
      feet.
